 * The implementation of the DTLTank sequence, which derives from the
 * AcceleratorSeq class. This is a container to be used in handling Drift Tube
 * Linacs These devices have RfGaps in them, which are controlled by a single
 * RfCavity. That is, the RfCavity contains the hooks to the klystron signals,
 * which control all of the RfGaps together. As the DTLTank is also a sequence,
 * it is possible for it to contain other types of nodes, such as quads and
 * BPMs.
